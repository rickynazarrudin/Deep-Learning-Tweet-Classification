# Deep Learning Tweet Emotion Classification

This programs do emotion classification in tweet datasets published by codalab at this link (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17751#learn_the_details-datasets) using deep learning, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). It classifies tweet into four classes (Joy, Fear, Sadness, Anger). These are the whole process i did in this program.

1. Dataset preparation
2. Dataset filtering
3. Create LSTM model
4. Training process
5. Testing and predict
6. Evaluation and classification report
